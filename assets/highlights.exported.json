With this in mind, it doesn't matter if we follow Scrum precisely or instead use Kanban. However, it's usually a good idea to scope out work before starting, creating estimates, and most importantly having clear Acceptance Criteria. I can help your team pick processes that align with the Agile manifesto and help them stay on track. "

The solution involved programmatically loading each page, checking for the presence of content types,  taking a snapshot and comparing the layout to the expected. This gave the client confidence to release changes sooner than they expected. "
